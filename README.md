🌲 Random Forest Classification on Custom Dataset
This repository demonstrates the application of the Random Forest algorithm for classification using a custom dataset (data.csv). The model is trained, evaluated, and visualized using Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

📁 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is located in data.csv.
It is assumed to be a tabular dataset suitable for classification tasks, with one target column and one or more feature columns.

🧠 Model: Random Forest Classifier
The Random Forest algorithm is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.


## 🧪 Steps Performed

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Train-test split
- Random Forest model training
- Evaluation using accuracy and classification report
- Feature importance visualization (optional)

## 🚀 Requirements

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

📊 Output
Accuracy and classification report printed to console

Optional feature importance plot for better interpretability

📎 Notes
Make sure to update "target" with the actual name of the label column.

You can tweak the number of estimators or other hyperparameters to improve performance.
